* Yes, it's written in PHP. No shame.

# SteamCMD Errors

| Error                                          | Possible Reason                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `ERROR! Timed out waiting for AppInfo update.` | Unknown                                           |
| `Login Failure: Rate Limit Exceeded (84)`      | Unknown                                           |
| `ERROR! Failed to install (No subscription)`   | Game not owned by any authorised accounts         |
| `Error! State is 0x202 after update job.`      | Not enough space to download game                 |
| `Error! State is 0x402 after update job.`      | Update required but not completed - check network |
| `Error! State is 0x602 after update job.`      | Update required but not completed - check network |

For other error codes, you can calculate the app's state(s) by converting the `0x000` code to decimal,
and finding which [AppState codes](https://github.com/lutris/lutris/blob/master/docs/steam.rst)
sum to the given code, which will give you some clues as to what's going on.

For example:
* [`0x402` to decimal](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=0x402+to+decimal) = 1026
* 1026 is the sum of:
    * 2:    `StateUpdateRequired`
    * 1024: `StateUpdateStarted`
